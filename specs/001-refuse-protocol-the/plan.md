- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
The REFUSE Protocol aims to create a universal data exchange standard for the waste management industry, transforming fragmented legacy systems into a unified, real-time, developer-friendly platform. This implementation plan prioritizes comprehensive industry research to inform protocol design decisions, ensuring the standard addresses real-world challenges and regulatory requirements.

Technical approach centers on creating an open-source protocol specification with reference implementations, comprehensive documentation, and developer tooling to enable ecosystem adoption.

**Constraints**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Research required - Regulatory compliance requirements vs Implementation flexibility vs Ecosystem adoption barriers]
**Scale/Scope**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Research required - Industry-wide protocol standard vs Company-specific implementation vs Regional compliance] scope boundaries

## REFUSE Protocol Context
This implementation follows the REFUSE (REcyclable & Solid waste Unified Standard Exchange) protocol constitution, ensuring:
- RESTful API-first design with JSON-native data exchange
- Semantic clarity in field naming and data structures
- Extensible design supporting legacy waste management system integration
- Backward compatibility for existing data patterns
- Comprehensive data archaeology capabilities for legacy system migration

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Initial Assessment**: ✅ PASS - No violations detected

### Compliance Verification
- ✅ **RESTful API-first**: Protocol design supports RESTful endpoints for data exchange
- ✅ **JSON-native**: Schema definitions use JSON with semantic field naming
- ✅ **Semantic clarity**: All protocol fields use descriptive, domain-specific terminology
- ✅ **Extensible**: Design supports metadata extensions for system-specific requirements
- ✅ **Backward compatible**: Protocol versioning strategy maintains compatibility
- ✅ **Data archaeology**: Transformation capabilities handle legacy data patterns

**No violations found. Constitution compliance confirmed.**

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure focused on protocol specification with supporting tooling and documentation

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Protocol specification language and format decisions
   - Schema definition and validation approach
   - Storage and distribution model for protocol artifacts
   - Testing strategy for protocol conformance
   - Performance optimization priorities
   - Regulatory compliance framework integration
   - Industry adoption and ecosystem development approach

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for REFUSE Protocol in waste management industry"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Analyze {tech option} adoption patterns in waste management industry"
   For each industry requirement:
     Task: "Investigate {requirement} compliance in waste management sector"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen based on research]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated and why rejected]
   - Industry context: [how this fits waste management ecosystem]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Core protocol entities: Customer, Service, Invoice, Route, Event
   - Legacy system integration entities
   - Regulatory compliance entities
   - Ecosystem participant entities

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Protocol specification contracts (schema definitions)
   - Data transformation contracts
   - Event streaming contracts
   - Integration bridge contracts
   - Output JSON Schema and OpenAPI specifications to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Schema validation tests
   - Protocol conformance tests
   - Data transformation tests
   - Integration compatibility tests

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Industry data migration scenarios
   - Multi-system integration scenarios
   - Regulatory compliance scenarios
   - Developer onboarding scenarios

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load research findings from research.md to inform task prioritization
- Generate protocol specification development tasks
- Create industry research validation tasks
- Develop data model implementation tasks
- Build testing and validation framework tasks
- Plan documentation and tooling tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Research-driven: Tasks ordered based on dependency analysis from industry research
- Protocol-first: Core specification before implementation details
- Testing-first: Validation tasks before development tasks
- Integration-focused: Legacy system compatibility testing early

**Estimated Output**: 20-30 protocol development tasks covering specification, research validation, implementation, and ecosystem tooling

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
