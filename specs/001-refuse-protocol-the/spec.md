## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Waste management industry stakeholders need a universal platform that transforms disconnected, proprietary systems into an interconnected ecosystem where any software can instantly integrate with any other software, enabling real-time data exchange and third-party application development without requiring deep domain expertise.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a waste hauler using legacy software systems, **When** they adopt the REFUSE Protocol platform, **Then** they can instantly connect any new software application without custom development or manual data mapping.

2. **Given** a software vendor wanting to enter the waste management market, **When** they build applications using the REFUSE Protocol, **Then** their products can immediately integrate with all existing waste management systems without requiring domain-specific knowledge.

3. **Given** a waste management company experiencing rapid growth through acquisition, **When** they need to consolidate multiple legacy systems, **Then** the REFUSE Protocol provides standardized data transformation that handles all legacy data patterns and inconsistencies automatically.

4. **Given** a developer community looking to build waste management applications, **When** they use the REFUSE developer tools and documentation, **Then** they can create functional applications without needing to understand complex waste management regulations, billing practices, or operational workflows.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when legacy systems contain data that doesn't match any standard schema patterns?
- How does the system handle real-time event processing during network outages?
- What occurs when third-party applications attempt to access data they shouldn't have permission to view?
- How are data consistency and synchronization maintained when multiple systems update the same information simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The platform MUST provide universal data schemas that normalize customer, service, invoice, and route information across all connected waste management systems
- **FR-002**: The platform MUST enable real-time, event-driven communication between different waste management software applications
- **FR-003**: The platform MUST allow third-party developers to build waste management applications without requiring deep domain expertise
- **FR-004**: The platform MUST transform and standardize data from legacy waste management systems, handling non-standard data storage patterns
- **FR-005**: The platform MUST provide a marketplace where third-party applications can be discovered and integrated by waste management companies
- **FR-006**: The platform MUST enable instant software integration without requiring custom development or manual data mapping
- **FR-007**: The platform MUST support real-time data streaming and live updates between connected systems
- **FR-008**: The platform MUST provide developer tools and SDKs that abstract away waste management domain complexity
- **FR-009**: The platform MUST handle data archaeology to clean and standardize data from decades-old legacy systems
- **FR-010**: The platform MUST enable waste management companies to consolidate operations after mergers and acquisitions through standardized data transformation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Waste Management Company**: Organization providing waste collection and disposal services, with attributes including company size, service areas, customer base, and integrated software systems
- **Legacy System**: Existing waste management software with proprietary data formats, inconsistent field naming, and creative data storage patterns accumulated over decades of operation
- **Third-Party Application**: Software built by external developers for specific waste management functions, requiring integration capabilities without domain expertise
- **Data Schema**: Standardized data structure that normalizes information across different systems, including customer demographics, service schedules, billing information, and operational data
- **Real-Time Event**: Instant notification system that enables live communication between connected waste management applications and systems
- **Developer Ecosystem**: Community of software developers building applications on the platform, supported by documentation, tools, and revenue-sharing models

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The protocol specification MUST be publicly available and implementation-agnostic, allowing integrators to implement security according to their specific requirements
- **NFR-002**: Implementations SHOULD use encryption at rest for all sensitive data including customer information, billing data, and operational records
- **NFR-003**: The protocol design MUST support but not require authentication and authorization mechanisms to be implemented by integrators
- **NFR-004**: Real-time event delivery MUST be guaranteed under 100ms for critical updates including service status changes, billing events, and route modifications
- **NFR-005**: The protocol MUST support event-driven architecture with guaranteed message delivery for all waste management operations
- **NFR-006**: The protocol MUST handle large-scale deployments with 100,000-1,000,000 customers and 10M+ data records per implementation
- **NFR-007**: Data transformation processes MUST scale to handle enterprise-level legacy system migrations with millions of historical records
- **NFR-008**: The protocol design MUST support comprehensive regulatory compliance including environmental reporting standards, workplace safety requirements, and data privacy regulations
- **NFR-009**: Data schemas MUST include fields for environmental impact tracking, safety compliance documentation, and regulatory reporting requirements
- **NFR-010**: The protocol MUST support full bidirectional synchronization with existing waste management systems including real-time API integration and event streaming capabilities
- **NFR-011**: Legacy system integration MUST support both push and pull data patterns with automatic conflict resolution for concurrent updates

## REFUSE Protocol Alignment
This specification aligns with REFUSE (REcyclable & Solid waste Unified Standard Exchange) protocol principles:
- **RESTful API-first**: All data operations designed as REST endpoints
- **JSON-native**: Data structures use human-readable field names
- **Semantic clarity**: Requirements use domain-specific terminology
- **Extensible**: Accommodates system-specific fields via metadata
- **Data archaeology**: Handles legacy data patterns and inconsistencies
