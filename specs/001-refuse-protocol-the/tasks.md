# Tasks: REFUSE Protocol - Universal Platform for Waste Management

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-refuse-protocol-the/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Phase Status

- **Phase 3.1**: [x] Core Entities - COMPLETED
- **Phase 3.2**: [x] Protocol Tools - COMPLETED
- **Phase 3.3**: [x] Entity Implementations - COMPLETED
- **Phase 3.4**: [x] Advanced Entity Features - COMPLETED
- **Phase 3.5**: [x] Integration & Ecosystem - COMPLETED

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Successfully loaded REFUSE Protocol implementation plan
   → Project type: protocol/data-standard with reference implementations
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extracted 16 core entities → 16 model implementation tasks
   → contracts/: Found 7 schema files → 7 contract test tasks
   → research.md: Extracted technical decisions → informed setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Protocol project initialization, tooling, dependencies
   → Tests: Schema validation tests, protocol conformance tests
   → Core: Entity models, protocol specification, reference implementations
   → Integration: Event streaming, legacy system bridges, validation tools
   → Polish: Performance testing, documentation, ecosystem tooling
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel implementation
   → Same file = sequential (no [P]) for conflict avoidance
   → Tests before implementation (TDD approach)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph with clear task relationships
7. Create parallel execution examples for [P] tasks
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All 7 contracts have corresponding test tasks ✅
   → All 16 entities have model implementation tasks ✅
   → Protocol specification and tooling tasks defined ✅
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Protocol project**: `protocol/`, `tests/`, `examples/`, `tools/` at repository root

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies between them
- All schema validation tests must fail initially (no implementation yet)
- Implement entities in dependency order: base entities before dependent entities
- Verify tests fail before implementing corresponding functionality
- Commit after each task completion
- Run contract tests continuously during development
- Focus on protocol specification quality and industry compliance
- Ensure all implementations follow REFUSE Protocol constitution principles

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → schema validation test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → TypeScript interface implementation [P]
   - Each entity → model implementation with business logic [P]
   - Entity relationships → relationship mapping implementation

3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each user story → integration test scenario [P]
   - Each workflow → end-to-end integration test

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Protocol Tools → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution
   - TDD: Tests before implementation

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [ ] All 7 contracts have corresponding validation test tasks
- [ ] All 16 entities have model implementation tasks
- [ ] Tests come before implementation (TDD order)
- [ ] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [ ] Each task specifies exact file path
- [ ] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [ ] Tasks ordered by clear dependencies
- [ ] Setup tasks before implementation tasks
- [ ] Core entities before advanced features
