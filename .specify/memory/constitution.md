# REFUSE Protocol Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. RESTful API-first
All data exchange operations MUST be accessible via REST endpoints. Protocol implementations MUST expose standardized HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for all data operations. This ensures consistent access patterns across diverse waste management systems and enables seamless integration with existing infrastructure.

**Rationale**: RESTful design provides universal accessibility and aligns with modern web standards, enabling the protocol to bridge legacy waste management systems with contemporary applications.

### II. JSON-native
JSON MUST be the primary data interchange format with optional XML support for legacy system compatibility. All endpoints MUST support JSON request/response bodies with proper MIME type declarations. Schema definitions MUST be JSON Schema compliant.

**Rationale**: JSON provides human-readable structure while maintaining machine efficiency, enabling easier debugging and integration across diverse programming environments.

### III. Semantic clarity
All field names MUST use human-readable, descriptive terminology with no abbreviations or technical jargon. Field naming MUST follow consistent patterns that clearly indicate purpose and relationship to business domains.

**Rationale**: Clear, unambiguous field names reduce integration errors and make the protocol accessible to domain experts who may not be technical specialists.

### IV. Extensible design
The protocol MUST support system-specific extensions through metadata fields while maintaining core schema compatibility. Extensions MUST be clearly documented and versioned separately from the core protocol specification.

**Rationale**: Waste management systems have unique operational requirements that must be accommodated without breaking standardized data exchange.

### V. Backward compatibility & Data archaeology
All version updates MUST maintain backward compatibility for existing integrations. The protocol MUST include capabilities to handle legacy data patterns, including misplaced fields, inconsistent naming conventions, and creative data storage approaches commonly found in established waste management systems.

**Rationale**: Legacy waste management systems often contain decades of accumulated data with inconsistent structures that must be preserved during migration to standardized formats.

## Data Exchange Standards

### Schema Requirements
- All data exchanges MUST validate against published JSON Schema definitions
- Required fields MUST be clearly documented and validated at protocol boundaries
- Optional fields MUST have sensible defaults defined in the specification

### Data Normalization
- Billing data MUST include standardized fields for service charges, taxes, and payment terms
- Customer data MUST normalize contact information, service locations, and account relationships
- Service data MUST standardize service types, schedules, and completion tracking
- Operational data MUST include waste types, quantities, processing methods, and environmental impact metrics

### Error Handling
- All API responses MUST include appropriate HTTP status codes
- Error responses MUST provide machine-readable error codes and human-readable descriptions
- Validation errors MUST specify exact field and constraint violations

## Implementation Requirements

### Integration Testing
- All protocol implementations MUST include comprehensive integration tests covering:
  - Cross-system data synchronization scenarios
  - Legacy system migration patterns
  - Error recovery and data validation
  - Performance under typical waste management data volumes

### Documentation Standards
- API documentation MUST be generated from schema definitions
- Implementation guides MUST include migration strategies for legacy systems
- Field definitions MUST include business context and validation rules

### Performance Standards
- API endpoints MUST respond within 500ms for typical requests
- Batch operations MUST handle up to 10,000 records efficiently
- Real-time synchronization MUST maintain data consistency across distributed systems

## Governance

### Amendment Process
This constitution establishes the foundational principles for the REFUSE protocol. Amendments require:
1. Documentation of the proposed change and its impact on existing implementations
2. Review by the protocol governance committee
3. Backward compatibility analysis and migration strategy
4. Publication of updated specification with clear version history

### Versioning Policy
- **MAJOR version** increments require governance committee approval and include breaking changes with migration guides
- **MINOR version** increments add new capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility
- **PATCH version** increments address implementation issues and clarifications

### Compliance Review
All protocol implementations and updates MUST be validated against this constitution. The governance committee maintains reference implementations and compliance test suites.
