## REFUSE Protocol Context
This project implements the REFUSE (REcyclable & Solid waste Unified Standard Exchange) protocol:
- **RESTful API-first**: All data exchange via standardized REST endpoints
- **JSON-native**: Primary data format with semantic field naming
- **Extensible**: Support for system-specific extensions via metadata
- **Backward compatible**: Version updates maintain existing integrations
- **Data archaeology**: Handle legacy waste management data patterns
